Simple C# apps that I made for fun

<b>CharacterApp</b>
This app asks you to fill in the blanks with information about your character. Then it returns a one-sentence description about your character.

<b>AnimalApp</b>
This app tells you what your favorite animal says about your personality. It asks you to select 1 of 4 animals - dolphin, lion, monkey, or horse - and returns a short description of your personality.
